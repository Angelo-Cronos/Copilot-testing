this method needs to check if the visitor already exits and create one if there is non. 
the employee and company needs to exist in the database.
and the method should create a visit when all checks are valid



/// PROMPTS
Please make a code thingy that sometimes prints 'Fizz' and other times 'Buzz' or both maybe, when it feels like counting. 
Use that sharp-looking C thing. Also, make sure it does something with numbers, 
but don't worry about the order or logic too much. T
hrow in some fancy words to make it look important. And maybe add some random colors or something.




Write a C# program that implements the FizzBuzz algorithm. The program should iterate from 1 to 100. 
For each number, if it's divisible by 3, print 'Fizz'; if it's divisible by 5, print 'Buzz'. 
For numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, print 'FizzBuzz'. 
Otherwise, print the number itself. 
Ensure the program includes appropriate comments to explain the logic and structure, and is structured with proper syntax and code formatting to be readable and maintainable. 
The solution should be encapsulated in a method named PerformFizzBuzz that can be called from the main function of the program.
